Our AI-powered Hospital Management System is a modern web-based platform designed to streamline hospital operations and enhance patient care through intelligent automation. The system supports three primary roles — Admin (Dean), Doctor, and Patient — each with dedicated dashboards and functionality tailored to their needs.

Patients can register, search for doctors based on specialization, and book appointments by checking real-time availability. Doctors manage their schedules, view patient histories, and benefit from AI-generated medical summaries and diagnosis suggestions. Admins configure hospital settings, departments, and working hours while accessing analytics and AI-powered forecasts for appointments and resources.

A key AI feature of the system is Report Summarization. Using Google Gemini 2.0 Flash, patients can upload their medical reports in PDF or image format, which are automatically summarized into clear, human-readable explanations. Uploaded reports are stored via Cloudinary, and their links are saved securely in Firebase.

We also introduced a Document Section, enabling patients to share medical documents that can be securely viewed by both doctors and the admin. This enhances collaboration, ensures transparency, and improves decision-making.

The system uses Firebase for real-time database management, authentication, and secure media storage, offering a seamless, scalable, and responsive experience. Integrated AI/ML modules enable smart scheduling, patient risk prediction, chatbot interactions, and feedback sentiment analysis.

This project minimizes manual tasks and empowers medical staff with intelligent tools for faster and more informed care delivery.
